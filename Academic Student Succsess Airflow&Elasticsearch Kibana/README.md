# Academic Student Succsess Airflow & ElasticSearch Kibana

This project focuses on optimizing and automating the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. This involves the seamless integration and transformation of data from diverse sources into a coherent structure, all facilitated by the Apache Airflow platform. Additionally, the project aims to generate a comprehensive report enriched with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) insights, leveraging a meticulously cleaned and Gx-validated dataset. The entire workflow, from data processing to report generation, will be elegantly orchestrated through an Airflow pipeline, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in data management and analysis.
